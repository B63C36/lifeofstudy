            and overcoming these challenges is all part of the learning process,
            particularly when you have a large workload.Such issues range from
            temporary glitches to chronic lack of motivation and low productivity.
            It can take what feels like extraordinary will-power to overcome these issues,
            but the important thing to remember is that they can be conquered with the right mind </div>	`

          <div class="col"> You have difficulty remembering facts and figures A common complaint among students
            at any stage in their education is that it’s difficult to remember all the information necessary for
            answering exam questions effectively. This is difficult enough when you’re only studying one
            subject, as at university, but when you’re studying numerous subjects, as at GCSE and A-level,
            remembering all the facts and figures from each of your subjects can seem a monumental task.
            Learning things properly in the first place will help your recollection come exam time </div>

  <h4> Lack of motivation </h4>

       <div class="row">
         <div class="col"><img src="images/lack.png" class="ifone" alt="ppa" height="204" width="320" ></div>
         <div class="col"> Lack of motivation can happen when someone is experiencing life stressors or changes,
           such as going away to school, changing jobs or work burnout, the death of a loved one, the ending of a
           relationship, illness,  overwhelm, or other major life transitions.7 Or, someone might have a mental
           health concern, like depression or an adjustment disorder, that’s aggravating their lack of motivation.
           hen someone has emotional, cognitive, and physical fatigue as a result of their work, they are likely
           experiencing burnout. Burnout can result in lower productivity, feelings of helplessness or frustration,
           reduced mental and physical health, and lowered motivation. If someone doesn’t feel a sense of belonging
           in the company and with their peers, it can lead to an increased risk of burnout. </div>
